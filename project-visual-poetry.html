            <p> This project is a personal project that I had been thinking about for a long time, as a vague idea, and that I just now managed to put into an actual shape I can show. </p>

			<p>	I believe in the power of words. To me, written words have the power to move someone, to make them feel something. One of the most powerful ways of sharing is using words, and through depicting an image, convey a feeling or an emotion.  </p>
			<p> I have been writing poetry for a few years, and have recently started to explore how I could add context to very abstract and personal words that might only have true meaning to myself and make them more universal. This project is still a work in progress, as I keep adding new poems while exploring new means of creations
            </p>
            <div class="chapter">
	            <h2 class="text-design title-project"> Chapter 1 - @VisualPoetryByJulie (ongoing) </h2>
	            <p> The newest iteration of this project is an Instagram account I created called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/visualpoetrybyjulie/" > @VisualPoetrybyJulie </a>. 
				I use the rows of 3 images that is characteristic of Instagram as a canvas to create a visual story to illustrate a poem. In this layout, I also include the title of the poem and the poem itself. It is a great opportunity to explore how fonts impact the meaning of words and how to actually make the text location and design accurately to the mood of the artwork. </p>
				<p> I have been using both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to create the visuals. This project is also a way for me to further my knowledge and explore new features of these software and see what I can create with them.</p>
				<p> I try to create one every week (trying is really the word here !)</p>
				<p> Here is a sneak peek of my favorites so far: </p>

				<h2 class="text-design title-project"> Chapter 2  - 360 - prototype (ongoing) </h2>
				<p> As part of a course I was taking on Visual storytelling, I developed a 360 visual interpretation of a haiku by Kobayashi Issa. </p>
				<p class="center"> Winter seclusion - <br>
									Listening, that evening, <br>
									To the rain in the mountain. <br>
									<b> - Kobayashi Issa </b> <br>
				</p>
				<p> Haikus are Japanese short poems. In only three lines, they capture the essence and intensity of a moment, underline the ephemerality of time, describe an everyday scene. <br>
				Mirroring the minimalism of haikus, this chapter of the project explores how a new layer of the story can be told by adding visuals to accompany simple words. Using graphic elements such as lines and dots, as well as constraining the color palette to black and white, the 360 visuals of this chapter create a new world around this already powerful story. </p>
				<p>
				have been using Adobe Illustrator to make the visuals and Adobe After Effects to animate them. I started by storyboarding where I wanted to put elements in my 360 video and how I wanted the animation to evolve. In parallel, I explored how to make 360 videos using After Effects and what were the constraints (distortion of the graphics mainly). </p>
				<p>
				I started by working on the last verse of the poem (which is the most advanced piece of my prototype) and then moved on to the first one.

				<h2 class="text-design title-project"> Chapter 3 - Sound Design </h2>
				<p> This iteration is the oldest one, my first dabble at creating something around poetry. I started by exploring how sounds could portray a very singular atmosphere and how I could use that to deliver my own interpretation of a poem. It is very interesting to explore how in both visual and sound the actual words can be used to fit the whole creation. </p>
				<p> The poem I chose for this chapter of the project is from one of my favorite poet, Charles Baudelaire. It is in French and it’s called - Le Spleen. It is about how sometimes you go to a dark place, and get very moody but don’t can’t really grasp or comprehend what is happening, except it is dark. <br>
				The atmosphere of the poem is very gloomy and melancholic, and I wanted to enhance that sensation. The poem is actually whispered and the sound elements are very echoey. </p>
